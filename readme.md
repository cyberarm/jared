# Jared - Ruby powered Digital Assistant (RDA)
Jared is a plugin-based application for managing your life,
at its core is just a bunch of plugins.
In the future I hope to have enough plugins for Jared to be able to function similar to Jarvis, but that is a ways off.
Jared has a few built-in plugins (See wiki page [plugins](https://wiki.github.com/cyberarm/jared/plugins)).
